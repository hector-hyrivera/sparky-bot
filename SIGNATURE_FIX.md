# Discord Signature Validation Fix

## Issue

Discord flagged your application with the error: "Your application failed an automated security check for its interactions endpoint url. You must validate the signature headers of interactions you receive."

## Root Cause

The main issue was that the `PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable was not properly configured in your Cloudflare Worker deployment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated wrangler.toml

Added the `PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable configuration:

```toml
[vars]
PUBLIC_KEY = "your-discord-application-public-key-here"
```

### 2. Enhanced Signature Validation

Improved the signature validation code with:

- Better error logging for debugging
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- More robust error handling

### 3. Added Debugging Tools

Created a test script to verify your configuration:

```bash
npm run test:signature
```

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Get Your Discord Application Public Key

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application (SparkyBot)
3. Go to the "General Information" tab
4. Copy your "Public Key"

### Step 2: Configure the Public Key

You have two options:

#### Option A: Set as Wrangler Secret (Recommended)

```bash
wrangler secret put PUBLIC_KEY
# Enter your Discord application public key when prompted
```

**Option B: Set in wrangler.toml**
Replace the placeholder in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
PUBLIC_KEY = "your-actual-public-key-here"
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Updated Worker

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 4: Test the Configuration

```bash
npm run test:signature
```

### Step 5: Re-add Your Interactions Endpoint

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/1369877980565737472/information)
2. Add your Cloudflare Worker URL as the interactions endpoint
3. The URL should be: `https://sparky-bot.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

## Verification

After deployment, Discord will automatically test your endpoint. The enhanced logging will help you debug any remaining issues:

- Check Cloudflare Worker logs for signature verification details
- Look for "Signature verification successful" messages
- If there are errors, they will be clearly logged

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Missing signature headers"

- **Cause**: PUBLIC_KEY not set or request not from Discord
- **Solution**: Ensure PUBLIC_KEY is properly configured

### Issue: "Bad request signature"

- **Cause**: Invalid signature or corrupted request body
- **Solution**: Check that the request is coming from Discord and body is not modified

### Issue: "Invalid timestamp"

- **Cause**: Clock skew between Discord and Cloudflare Workers
- **Solution**: The code now allows 5 minutes of clock skew

## Security Notes

- Never commit your actual public key to version control
- Use Wrangler secrets for sensitive environment variables
- The signature validation prevents unauthorized requests to your bot
- All Discord interactions must be validated before processing

## Testing

You can test your endpoint manually by:

1. Using Discord's built-in verification in the Developer Portal
2. Checking the Cloudflare Worker logs for successful signature verification
3. Running the test script: `npm run test:signature`
